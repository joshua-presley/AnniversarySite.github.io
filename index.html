                    You've made this past year so wonderful. Everything about you is perfect, and every day I wonder how I'm so lucky to have someone like you as my girlfriend.

                        Your smile is the only thing I ever need in my life. Your laugh is infectious. You support me so much and I don't know what I'd do without you. I love your passion, your drive, your bangs, and your butt ;) Every day you're the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think about before falling asleep. You know me so well and always know what to say. I can't wait for the quarantine to be over so I can take you out more, and I appreciate you coming over so much to keep me company in my apartment. Thank you for everything that you do, here's to our first of many anniversaries!
